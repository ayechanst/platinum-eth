So we mentioned that wallets are like a protective shell for accounts, but what does that
mean precisely?

Think of wallets as... robot butlers... with a safe for a chest.

> OK, what the heck?

Remember that EOAs are controlled by private keys. The safe thats the robot butler's chest is
where all the private keys are kept. Mrs. Private Key works at our train station, but she does
not live there.

Instead, imagine she lives inside the robot butler like some sort of Pokemon. This is because
private keys are never on the blockchain. Blockchains are public, and if Mrs. Private key lived
in our train station, than that theif could have just forced her to sign off on the fraudulent
train.

She was gone because she was inside the robot butler, and the robot butler doens't live on chain
either! Ok, so the robot has a safe to protect private keys, but why is he a butler?

**Q:** I know EOAs have an address, but what's a wallet address?

**A:** What this person is referring to with the word "wallet address" is just the address of the
primary EOA associated with your wallet.

Technically, wallets don't have an address. But as with the word "account" referring to an EOA, the
word "wallet address" is used to refer to the primary address of the EOA associated with your wallet.

# Wallets live to serve, like butlers!

It's beginning to sound like wallets do more than just hold private keys. Wallets exist to make
the user experience in crypto better. In your train station, how would you load funds into a train?
How would you sign the paperwork for the train? How do you tell the train where to go? This is why
eveyone needs a robot butler, to do all those things for us.

The first thing you do when using a Web3 app is to connect your wallet. Then you start clicking
buttons, transacting, "signing", and all those goodies. Your wallet is doing all the behind-the-scenes
work, while you have a nice user interface that makes you forget about all the complicated defi
protocol stuff!

<!-- # The butler can also teleport.

Wallets can manage multiple accounts. Wallets are not part of the blockchain, so they don't adhere
to blockchain physics.

# Robot Butlers make private keys

If you've made a new wallet (not a new account), you'll have been given a seed phrase. This seed
phrase -->

<!-- # Improving User Experience

Crypto wallets exist to make management easier. Wallets are also
essential for improving the user experience, and make crypto accessible to everyone without
drowning them in details.

When you make a new software wallet, the wallet will give you a seed phrase. From this seed phrase
a private key is derived (as we explored in the EOA section), which derives a public key, which
derives an address.

A wallet can manage multiple EOAs. Multiple private keys can be made from a single seed phrase.
The butler is so good at his job he can essentially teleport to which ever station he needs to be at.

# Where are wallets?

**Not** on the blockchain!
Wallets, unlike EOAs and transactions, are **not** part of the blockchain. Instead they interact with
your EOAs on the blockchain using your private keys you gave the wallet access to.

The robot butler's
chest is a safe with all your private keys inside. The combination to open it is your seed phrase.
If the butler has your keys, and the butler is not on chain, than neither are your keys!

Private keys will **never** be on the blockchain, or else everyone could see them and start forging
transactions like crazy! -->
