> They who control the private key control the BALANCE!

Think of wallets as... robot butlers... with a safe for a chest.

![Robot Butler](/images/butler.svg)

> OK, what the heck?

Remember that EOAs are controlled by private keys. The safe that's the robot butler's chest is
where all the private keys are kept. Mrs. Private Key works at our train station, but **she does not live there.**

Instead, she lives inside the robot butler's chest safe like a Pokemon. Why? If she stayed at
your train station, then the theif could have forced her to sign her signature.

Everything on-chain is public, so having a wallet and private keys on-chain would make the private
key useless! That's why private keys and wallets are off-chain.

Ok, so the butler keeps the keys safe, but why is he a butler and not just a safe?

> Give me your **wallet address** so I can send you some ETH tokens.

**Q:** I know EOAs have an address, but what's a wallet address?

**A:** What this person is referring to with the word "wallet address" is just the address of the
primary EOA associated with your wallet.

Technically, wallets don't have an address. But as with the word "account" referring to an EOA, the
word "wallet address" is used to refer to the primary address of the EOA associated with your wallet.

# Wallets live to serve, like butlers!

Wallets exist to make the user experience in crypto better.

- In your train station, how would you load funds into a train?
- How would you sign the paperwork for the train?
- How do you tell the train where to go?

This is where the robot butler comes in. You click buttons on a decentralized app "instructing" your
butler what to do, and he takes care of the rest!

Storytime:

**Chapter 1: You owe some money**

<!-- # The butler can also teleport.

Wallets can manage multiple accounts. Wallets are not part of the blockchain, so they don't adhere
to blockchain physics.

# Robot Butlers make private keys

If you've made a new wallet (not a new account), you'll have been given a seed phrase. This seed
phrase -->

  <summary>TOTAL RECALL</summary>

Instead of performing active recall, let's do some total recall. Answer the
following in your head:

> **Why** does Mrs. Private Key provide a signature for outgoing trains?

> **How** do addresses provide us with information about EOAs?

> **What** does the private key of an EOA control fundamentally?

> **How** does the private key control this one thing?

<!-- # Improving User Experience

Crypto wallets exist to make management easier. Wallets are also
essential for improving the user experience, and make crypto accessible to everyone without
drowning them in details.

When you make a new software wallet, the wallet will give you a seed phrase. From this seed phrase
a private key is derived (as we explored in the EOA section), which derives a public key, which
derives an address.

A wallet can manage multiple EOAs. Multiple private keys can be made from a single seed phrase.
The butler is so good at his job he can essentially teleport to which ever station he needs to be at.

# Where are wallets?

**Not** on the blockchain!
Wallets, unlike EOAs and transactions, are **not** part of the blockchain. Instead they interact with
your EOAs on the blockchain using your private keys you gave the wallet access to.

The robot butler's
chest is a safe with all your private keys inside. The combination to open it is your seed phrase.
If the butler has your keys, and the butler is not on chain, than neither are your keys!

Private keys will **never** be on the blockchain, or else everyone could see them and start forging
transactions like crazy! -->
