> They who control the private key control the BALANCE!

Think of wallets as... robot butlers... with a safe for a chest.

> OK, what the heck?

Remember that EOAs are controlled by private keys. The safe that's the robot butler's chest is
where all the private keys are kept. Mrs. Private Key works at our train station, but **she does not live there.**

Instead, she lives inside the robot butler's chest safe like a Pokemon. Why? If she stayed at
your train station, then the theif could have forced her to sign her signature.

Everything on-chain is public, so having a wallet and private keys on-chain would make the private
key useless! That's why private keys and wallets are off-chain.

Ok, so the butler keeps the keys safe, but why is he a butler and not just a safe?

> Give me your **wallet address** so I can send you some ETH tokens.

**Q:** I know EOAs have an address, but what's a wallet address?

**A:** What this person is referring to with the word "wallet address" is just the address of the
primary EOA associated with your wallet.

Technically, wallets don't have an address. But as with the word "account" referring to an EOA, the
word "wallet address" is used to refer to the primary address of the EOA associated with your wallet.

# Wallets live to serve, like butlers!

Wallets exist to make the user experience in crypto better.

- In your train station, how would you load funds into a train?
- How would you sign the paperwork for the train?
- How do you tell the train where to go?

This is where the robot butler comes in. You click buttons on a decentralized app "instructing" your
butler what to do, and he takes care of the rest!

# Storytime

**Chapter 1: You owe some money** Your friend needs ETH tokens. So you get on MetaMask (your wallet,
your "butler"), type your friend's train station address, select how much ETH you want to send, and
click "send".

**Chapter 2: Back in Platinum-Eth** Your butler springs into action! He assembles a train, he shovels
charcoal (gas) into the train, he shovels a pile of tokens into the train, he lets Mrs. Private Key
sign her signature, and sends the train on its way!

**Chapter 3: Moral** When you are interacting with your EOA, you are doing so through your wallet.
Your robot butler manages everything so you can focus on the important things like **who** you're
sending to, and **how much**.
