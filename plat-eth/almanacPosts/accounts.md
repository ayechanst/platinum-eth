There are two kinds of accounts, their similarities and differences will be discussed here.

### [Externally Owned Accounts](/almanacPosts/eoa)

These accounts are controlled by real people, and are the only account that can initiate transactions.
You know what else initiates train-sactions? Train stations! Think of EOAs as train stations. They are
where trains are initiated on their journey across the blockchain!

### [Smart Contract Accounts](/almanacPosts/smartContracts)

These accounts are controlled by no one! "Smart contract accounts" go by just "smart contracts", because
its implied that they're accounts, keep in mind they are still technically accounts! Smart contracts
receive transactions and do different things depending on the transaction. What else takes in "stuff"
and outputs "stuff"? Factories! Think of smart contracts as fully autonamous factories. They take in
raw material and make something new with it.

# Differences

**EOA**

- EOAs have public and private keys that control the account. These keys are **external** from the
  blockchain. The keys are managed by [wallets](/almanacPosts/wallets) or by their owners.

- Only EOAs can initiate transaction. The private keys that control the account allows them to prove
  that it was **this** EOA that sent a transaction. Smart contracts don't have private keys, so they
  can only send transactions in response to an EOA sending a transaction.

Both train stations and factories can hold value. They have little safes in them. They can also
