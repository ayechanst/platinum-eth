## Externally Owned Account (EOA)

These accounts are controlled by real people, and are the only account that can initiate transactions.
You know what else initiates train-sactions? Train stations! Think of EOAs as train stations. They are
where trains are initiated on their journey across the blockchain!

What's the difference between an
EOA and a wallet? They seem very similar. Wallets are software that manages your accounts. Think of them
as... robot butlers. They work behind your screen and pull levers so you don't have to. One
wallet can manage several accounts, just like how a butler can manage several train stations.

What are accounts? There are two types of accounts, and you've interacted with both
by connecting your burner wallet! The first kind is an externally owned account, or
EOA for short, and the second kind are smart contracts.

Accounts are a fundamental concept for blockchains, so fundamental that the Ethereum
network can be boiled down in one sentence using accounts:

> A network of accounts sending transactions to each other.

  <summary>Can you guess what type of account you connected your wallet to? (click for answer)</summary>

A smart contract account! You connected to it so you can grab funds. Or rather, request that
the smart contract give you funds through a transaction.

How should we explain and remember EOAs? Think of them as train stations, they have a lot in common.

Wait, send trains? EOAs can't send trains they arn't even a physical construct. You are
right, but I will extend the analogy of EOAs as train stations, to transactions being
trains. And smart contracts will be autonamous factories! When you give yourself funds
from the faucet you connected to, picture this:

> A train station (you) sends a train (trainsaction) carrying instructions to the factory (the smart contract). The factory executes the instructions, and sends you back a train full of money!

As stated earlier, almost everything is either a train station, or a factory, and they
all communicate and trade using trains! Now lets zoom in on EAOs to see how they work.
