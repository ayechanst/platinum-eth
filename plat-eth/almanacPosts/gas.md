Gas is a fee for transactions to go through. There are two main reasons:

1. Pay the checkpoint workers (the **validators**) for their good work
2. Prevent people from causing train-traffic-jams by overworking the validators

## Paying the validators

When the validators at the checkpoint inspected Mrs. Private Key's signature and
compared it to your station's address, they used a lot of time and energy because
Mrs. Private Key has very bad handwritting.

> Validator's job is to keep the blockchain safe from theives.

We pay a fee to the validators because they provide a safe place for us to send
transactions.

## Prevent people from clogging the network

Imagine validators were **not** paid for the following story:

**Chapter 1: Revenge of the Theif** Upon failing to steal your funds, the theif
is mad at the validators. To get revenge he decides he's going to make them work
very very hard.

**Chapter 2: The Plan** The theif decides he's going to send one trillion trains
to his friend so that the validators need to validate one trillion signatures.

**Chapter 3: The Result** One morning, the validators look out their window, and
see a dark line approaching their checkpoint. As it gets closer, they realize it's
not a line, its ONE TRILLION TRAINS! Their day is ruined, everyone else who sent
trains this morning days is ruined, and everyone has to wait a very long time for
their train to get to the destination.

Ok that sucks. Luckily the validators **are** paid. If the theif had to pay for
one trillion trains to be validated, he would transform from a theif, to a homeless
theif.

Even if someone isn't trying to overload the validators, gas fees still make people
think carefully before making transactions, since they're the ones paying.
