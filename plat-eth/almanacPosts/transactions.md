Transations are like trains (train-saction). They carry things from one place to another.

# ðŸŽŸ Simple NFT Example

We collected funds from the faucet, so that our train station has the means to fuel our train
when we mint some NFTs. Trains use **gas** to get places, notice the cart full of charcoal
in the illustration.

That's it! We'll revisit transactions when its time to mint. [Back to Challenge 0](/posts/2simpleNFT)

<!-- There are **three** main kinds of trainsactions. The first kinds are transactions
between EOAs, the second is a transaction from an EOA to a smart contract,
and the third transaction is an EOA deloying a smart contract account.

## 1. Transactions between train stations

![regular trainsaction](http://localhost:3000/images/train.svg)

Regular transactions happen between two accounts, like when you send your friend some ETH.
These transactions are the most basic and carry the following cargo, which you can track
yourself by looking at the transactions tab under your account's address on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)
and clicking on the transaction hash.

## Cargo

### 1.1 Value

Value are the tokens being transfered. The wagon that says "V" on it represents this data field.
If you check [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), you'll be able to find a field by clicking on
transactions hashes that displays how much value was sent in the trainsaction.

### 1.2 Signature

The signature is your train station's stamp of approval. It says: "This transaction comes from
from my address and I approve this trainsaction". The wagon is depicted with an "S" on it for
signature. Think of it like a big peice of paper that Mrs. Private Key stamped with a big red
wax seal.

### 1.3 Gas

The trainsaction needs gas to move. Think of the gas as coal fuel for the train, depicted by
the "G" wagon. Read more about [gas](/almanacPosts/gas) here if you're curious.

### 1.4 "To" Address

In the train's cockpit, there is a display that tells the train which train station its heading
to.

### 1.5 "From" Address

On the paper with the signature on it, is a "from address" that indicates which train station the
train is headed from.

- The "from address" is crucial to [node validators](/almanacPosts/nodeValidators) (the space ships
  supervising the construction of blockchains) to prevent fraudulent trains. Node validators use the
  "from address" to decrypt Mrs. Private Key's signature. If the signature and the "from address"
  match up, the train continues onto its destination.
- The "from address" is also important so train stations know who sent them value!

### 1.6 Nonce

Printed on the side of the train is a nonce. A nonce is a number that indicates the current number
of trains a train station has sent. The nonce is important for train stations sending value to
each other, because if I sent several trains to my friend, I want to be sure that the
trains arrive in the correct order to avoid complications.

# 2. Transactions from train stations to factories

When you interact with a smart contract, you are sending a trainsaction to it. These trains are different
from trains being sent between train stations.

# 3. Smart Contract Deployment (its a transaction too!)
