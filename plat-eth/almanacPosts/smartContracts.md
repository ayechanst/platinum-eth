The second type of account is a **smart contract account**, also known a simply "smart contract".
Smart contracts are like factories because they take in material, and do things with that
material.

# ðŸŽŸ Simple NFT Example

Smart contracts are executable code that is stored at a particular **address** on the blockchain.
They inhabit the same "plane of existence" as train stations.

Remember the **data input** cart from the trainsaction section? Part of the input data specifies
which sections of the executable code to run.

The smart contract has the following relevant attributes that will be used to explain the flow
of the whole challenge:

### Address

Just like train stations, factories have addresses too. Addresses are a way of organizing accounts
so that users can immidiately distinguish them from one another.

### Code Hash
