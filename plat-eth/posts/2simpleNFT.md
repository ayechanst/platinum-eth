# Checkpoint 1: ⛽️ Gas & Wallets 👛

The first step to this challenge is connecting your burner wallet so you can grab
funds to pay for gas. Why do we need to connect our wallets and pay for gas? We're
not even driving anywhere. And what's the difference between an account and a
wallet?

In this challenge we will cover the basics of accounts, transactions, wallets, and
gas. Follow your curiosity! Click the headers to be taken to the [alamanac](/almanacPosts)
where concepts are explained in more detail, and learn about the Platinum-Ethereum
cannonical universe!

## [Accounts](/almanacPosts/accounts)

What are accounts? There are two types of accounts, and by the end of the challenge
you'll have interacted with both!

1. The first kind of account is an externally owned account, or EOA for short. These
   accounts are owned by real people, hence the externally owned part. The jargon for
   externally owned accounts are EOA, or just accounts.

2. The second kind is a smart contract account. People just call these smart contracts
   for short. But just know, smart contracts are technically accounts too!

We can use the words accounts and transactions to describe the Ethereum ecosystem in the most
general sense.

> Ethereum is network of accounts sending transactions to each other.

#### Transactions

Anything sent between accounts are transactions. What do they look like? Transactions are just like trains.
They come from somewhere, they go somewhere, they use fuel, and they carry stuff! In fact, the funds
you're grabbing is the fuel for the train. In the next step, you're going to be minting some NFTs,
and you'll need gas to power the trains! Think of transactions as "train-sactions".

#### Externally Owned Account (EOA)

These accounts are controlled by real people, and are the only account that can initiate transactions.
You know what else initiates train-sactions? Train stations! Think of EOAs as train stations. They are
where trains are initiated on their journey across the blockchain!

What's the difference between an
EOA and a wallet? They seem very similar. Wallets are software that manages your accounts. Think of them
as... robot butlers. They work behind your screen and pull levers so you don't have to. One
wallet can manage several accounts, just like how a butler can manage several train stations.

The difference is important as wallets and accounts are conflated often. Metamask even has a article
about it: [What's the difference between a wallet and an account?](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/13466457757211-What-s-the-difference-between-a-wallet-and-an-account)

# Checkpoint 2: 🖨 Minting

Once you have your funds, we can start minting! Let's break everything down so we know exactly what is
going on.

#### Smart Contract Account

Smart contracts are accounts that no one has access to. They receive train-sactions, and do stuff! No
one is allowed in a smart contract. What other type of building receives "stuff" and returns other
"stuff"? Factories! Fully autonamous factories where no humans are allowed. Think of smart contracts
as factories. Also "smart contract" is jargon for "smart contract account". People don't specify that
they're accounts but just know this in the back of your head:

> Smart contracts are accounts too!
