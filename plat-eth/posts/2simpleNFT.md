Welcome to challenge 0! This challenge is about minting some NFTs for yourself, and we're going
to explain what's going on behind the scenes in this straight-forward challenge.

# Checkpoint 0: The Building Blocks

Web3 can be summarized in this one sentence:

> Ethereum is network of **accounts** sending **transactions** to each other.

Understanding those two fundamental building blocks: **accounts** and **transactions** will help explain
gas and wallets.

**Transactions** are like trains, they allow accounts to send resources and communicate. If transactions
are like trains, then **accounts** must be like train stations!

### [Externally Owned Accounts](/almanacPosts/eoa)

Once you get your funds for gas, the funds will be stored in your externally owned account. It's like
your home base. Click the link to read this section.

> BUT WAIT! I connected my **wallet** to get funds, not my **account**.

Don't worry, your account is "in" your wallet. Your wallet is like a protective shell for your accounts.

# Checkpoint 1: ‚õΩÔ∏è Gas & Wallets üëõ

We know what an EOA is now, and that our funds are in our EOA, not in a our wallet. So what is a wallet
for then? And what is gas for?

### [Wallets](/almanacPosts/wallets)

A wallet is an off-chain tool that holds **private keys** in order to manage **EOA**s.

### [Gas](/almanacPosts/gas)

Remember those kind checkpoint workers who stopped that theif from stealing? Without gas, your funds
might have gotten stolen!

# Checkpoint 2: üñ® Minting

Cool, so we know why gas and wallets exist. Thanks to our robot butler and the validators, we can
safely send trains and prevent robberies.

EOAs can do simple things like store balances, but how can we do complex things like mint NFTs?
Let's intorduce a new building to our railway network: **Factories**. Smart contracts are like
factories because they take in material, and output a result.

### [Smart Contracts](/almanacPosts/smartContracts)

A smart contract is the other type of account. The difference is that while an EOA can be
represented as a **balance** associated with an **address**, a smart contract is represented as
**executable code** associated with an **address**.

Code is executed by sending a transaction to the smart contract's address. Let's dive in!

### [Transactions](/almanacPosts/transactions)

Trains are a tool to move value around between accounts. But that's not the only thing they can do.
In this challenge, we arn't sending any value. We're minting an NFT, but how can a train do that?
**What** do they carry other than value that allows them to do that?

So let's look at trains now. Go ahead and send a train
now by minting youself an NFT, so we can look at it!

### [NFTs](/almanacPosts/nft)

Non-fungible tokens. There is a lot of information about these on the internet but none that are
Platinum-Eth style.
