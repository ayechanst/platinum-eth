# Checkpoint 1: ⛽️ Gas & Wallets 👛

To explain gas we need to explain transactions, and to explain wallets we need to
explain accounts. Accounts and transactions are the building blocks of Web3!

🥇 The first step to this challenge is connecting your burner wallet so you can grab
funds to pay for gas. Why do we need to connect our wallets and pay for gas? 🤔 We're
not even driving anywhere. And what's the difference between an account and a
wallet? 🤨

In this challenge we will cover the basics of accounts, transactions, wallets, and
gas. Follow your curiosity! Click the headers to be taken to the [alamanac](/almanacPosts)
where concepts are explained in more detail, and learn about the Platinum-Ethereum
cannonical universe!

## Wallets ![wallet](http://localhost:3000/images/wallet.svg)

Put wallets in the "not part of the blockchain" section of your mind. Wallets are software that
manage your accounts. They are crucial for user experience, so that new people to crypto have an
easier time interacting with the ecosystem. Wallets and accounts are mixed up often as they are
so closley related, Metamask even wrote a short article about the mix-up:

## [Accounts](/almanacPosts/accounts)

So wallets hold accounts, but what are accounts? There are two types of accounts, and
by the end of the challenge you'll have interacted with both!

The first kind of account is an externally owned account, or EOA for short. These
accounts are owned by real people, hence the externally owned part. The jargon for
externally owned accounts are EOA, or just accounts. Wallets hold EOAs!

## Transactions

Anything sent between accounts are transactions. What do they look like? Transactions are just like trains.
They come from somewhere, they go somewhere, they use fuel, and they carry stuff! In fact, the funds
you're grabbing is the fuel for the train. In the next step, you're going to be minting some NFTs,
and you'll need gas to power the trains! Think of transactions as "train-sactions".

## Gas

Now that we know what transactions are, we know what gas is!

# Checkpoint 2: 🖨 Minting

Once you have your funds, we can start minting! Let's break everything down so we know exactly what is
going on.

We can use the words accounts and transactions to describe the Ethereum ecosystem in the most
general sense.

> Ethereum is network of accounts sending transactions to each other.

#### Smart Contract Account

Smart contracts are accounts that no one has access to. They receive train-sactions, and do stuff! No
one is allowed in a smart contract. What other type of building receives "stuff" and returns other
"stuff"? Factories! Fully autonamous factories where no humans are allowed. Think of smart contracts
as factories. Also "smart contract" is jargon for "smart contract account". People don't specify that
they're accounts but just know this in the back of your head:

> Smart contracts are accounts too!
