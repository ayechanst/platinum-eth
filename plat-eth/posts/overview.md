# The Ethereum Ecosystem Overview

The Ethereum ecosystem fundamentally is a network of accounts sending transactions
to smart contracts, and other accounts. With this simple explanation, we can start
building a model world for explanation, understanding, and remembering.

What are our peices so far?

- Accounts
- Smart Contracts
- Transactions

Let's lock these three things into memory with a story.

# Train Station

Accounts are train stations owned by real people. These train stations is where
people keep their money and belongings. To communicate with other accounts,
train stations send transactions to each other.

# Trains

Transactions are like trains, add an "i" to transaction to make the word trainsaction.
These trains carry materials for factories, gas, money, and other things we'll cover
in depth later.

# Factories

Smart Contracts are another kind of account, but these accounts behave more like factories
than train stations. Trains unload their material at factories, the factories proccesses
the material, stores material, and sends a new train back to the train station. Sometimes
factories send trains to other factories. Smart contracts can do a lot of things, so we
won't explain them in this summary.

# Combining train stations, trains, and factories to build our world

Our world is sci-fi. Imagine a long row of planet sized blocks in outer space, connected
by a thick chain. On the surface of the blocks, there are thousands of train stations and
factories spread out with millions of trains flying through the air to different blocks.
Welcome to the world of Platinum Ethereum.
