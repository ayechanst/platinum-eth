# Checkpoint 1: Gas and Wallet

So the first step is connecting your burner wallet. What does that even mean really?
Burner wallets will make later when you understand what a normal wallet is. And
before covering what a wallet is, we need to cover what wallets hold, which are
accounts.

# Accounts (Context)

Think of Ethereum accounts as buildings on a block. There are two sorts of accounts,
normal accounts and smart contract accounts. Normal accounts are for holding value
and are also known as EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts), because they are owned by
humans. This section is about EOAs. EOAs can be thought of as train stations.

Why? The Ethereum ecosystem is a network of accounts interacting with each other
through transactions. Think of transactions as trains, or trainsactions.

# Accounts definition

An account is a concept defined by five attributes:

1. A private key
2. A public key
3. An address
4. A balance
5. A nonce

Accounts are train stations, because you use them to send transctions (trainsactions)
to other accounts.

- Mrs. Private Key
  A private key lady who signs transactions and takes care of paper work

- Ms. Public Key
  An outgoing lady who verifies transactions

The train station is located at a certain **address**
The train station also has a balance of tokens
The train station has a nonce, or a record of how many trains have passed through it
