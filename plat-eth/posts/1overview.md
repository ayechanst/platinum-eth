# Introduction

Platinum Ethereum is an open-source project dedicated to teaching the
Web3 ecosystem to Web2 developers.

If you are completely new to programming,
check out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The best way
The Odin Project creator's describe it is: "What I wish I had when I was
learning".

It's been the inspiration for Platinum Ethereum, and I wanted to
bring their teaching methods to Web3. It serves as the "last stop" before
you're ready to build your own projects, and land a job!

Platinum-Eth is carefully structured to introduce articles and concepts
**as the become relevant**, so that you arn't bouncing around tutorials and
going down rabbit-holes that arn't yet relevant. If a concept doesn't make
sense yet, hold on, because as you progress concepts will be re-visited and
things will start making sense. If you need to do your own research, stay
focused and avoid endless tutorials!

We will start by getting familiar with the three building blocks of Web3:
**accounts**, **smart contracts**, and **transactions**, by using a grand
cannonical-universe analogy.

Platinum Ethereum is a collection of articles structured around hands-on
projects from [Speed Run Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/).

You will build **skill** completeing Speed-Run-Eth challenges, and you will
build **knowledge** completeing Platinum-Eth sections.
