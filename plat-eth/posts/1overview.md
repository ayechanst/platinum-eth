# Under Construction

Platinum-Eth is being built right now. For now
the site is being designed and formatted. The first thing that will be done is challenge 0:
Simple NFT and I will work on the challenges in order. Stay tuned!

# The Goal of Platinum-Eth

Platinum-Eth is a course that helps you build a model of how the Ethereum ecosystem works,
by guiding you through the "behind the scenes" of each [Speed Run Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/)
challenge.

The goal of the course is to provide you with context and knowledge at the same pace you
would be applying the knowledge in each Speed Run Ethereum challenge. This course is **not**
supposed to feel like:

> Remember this, now remember that, don't forget this,

but rather:

> Here's this thing, here's what it's made of, it exists for these reasons... ect.

Don't pressure yourself to remember. As you progress through the challenges the
information will naturally stick because you'll have a real-world application.

To make things stick more naturally, I've wrapped knowledge and context within a story.
You'll notice a lot of metaphors in Platinum-Eth. These metaphors are more than just a
teaching aid, they serve as anchors for knowledge. The anchors keep knowledge from floating
out of your brain as you progress and eventually surpass what this course can teach you.

The anchors for the knowledge all rest on top of a world called
Platinum-Ethereum. I chose the name because to "platinum," a game means earning every achievement. It is the opposite of "speed running" a game. The world/course creates a
"middle road" where you are not forced to speed run through Ethereum, nor are you forced to
consume endless blogs, videos, or documentation. You have the choice to lean into as much or
as little of the roads offered.

## Where the anchors lay

The world of Platinum-Eth is the context in which the anchors lay. The locations, characters,
and events are the anchors to which the knowledge is tied. The dynamics between the context and
the anchors create the emergent property of a **Ethereum Ecosystem** model.

Stories form the dynamics of the world. This design choice was made because brains are
better evolved to recall stories that involve places, people, and events we can picture
in our heads rather than remembering procedures involving concepts, objects, and code.

## That is to say...

Do not overlook the analogies within Platinum-Eth. I encourage you to do your own research
if the analogies do not sit well with you, only you know how you learn best.
All this course is, is a culmination of my own research packaged in a manner I hope can
be more easily understood than independent research.

Platinum-Eth is a model, not documentation. In fact, most of my information comes from the
[Ethereum Documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/). A model
is an inaccurate representation of something. It's these inaccuracies that make models such a
useful tool because we can focus our attention on what's important.

If you're going through
Speed Run Ethereum, I'm assuming what is important to you is becoming a builder in Web3 and
joining the [Build Guild](https://app.buidlguidl.com/)! Platinum-Eth's model focuses on
a holistic understanding of blockchain. It is not tailored to any profession in Web3
in particular, but rather to all occupations. As you move out of here, you will have
a model you can extend and modify to suit your needs! Good Luck!

# FEED BACK

Feed back will be different from beginners and veterans, so I split the surveys.
Newbies tell me how the course **feels**, vets tell me how the course **is**.

## FEED BACK from newbies

Platinum-Ethereum is everything I know about the blockchain so far. It solves my problems and
questions **I** used to have. This was the only logical starting point for me, but
this course isn't for me it's for **you**!

**Idea Building**

My goal was to introduce **just enough** information required to move onto the next concept,
not overwhelm or skip over. How well did I do?

**Tone**

My goal was to write in a engaging and inquisitive manner, without much fluff. How well did
I accomplish this goal?

**Stories (both newbs and vets)**

My goal was to wrap complexity into simple stories. The stories should convey
the utility of the complexity without revealing the complexity. Stories should also be memorable.
How well did I accomplish this goal?

**Active Recall Exercizes**

My goal with active recall was to ask beyond-surface-level questions. They should be somewhat
open ended. My aim was to create questions similar to a
[Socratic Seminar](https://www.teachthought.com/critical-thinking/definition-of-socratic-seminar/)
where people just discuss a topic to gain insight about it.

**Paragraph Density**

My goal here was to convey ideas in less words, like writing an elegant program: it does a lot, but
it's **short**. How well did I accomplish this goal?

**Jargon Alert!**

How useful were these? Are there any other terms I should add? Is a Q&A form of defining jargon
helpful or should I directly define it? How well did I define terms overall?

**Syntax**

Are there any ambigous sentences where you weren't sure what I was trying to say?

## FEED BACK from veterans

How's the content, structure, and flow?

**Scope Relevance**

My goal here was to introduce concepts only as they came up in the Speed Run Eth challenges as not
to overwhelm learners, and also make sure they immediately saw the concept being brought up. How
well was this accomplished?

**Stories (both newbs and vets)**

My goal was to wrap complexity into simple stories. The stories should convey
the utility of the complexity without revealing the complexity. How well did I accomplish this
goal?

**Metaphors**

From the way you visualize the block chain as a model, how relevant are the metaphors? My goal was
to link Web3 ideas to the real world in one continuous metaphor. How well did I accomplish this?

**Target Audience**

My target audience are new people who know nothing about the blockchain, does the content reflect
that? Is anything too "out of reach" or irrelevant for most jobs in Web3?

**Correctness/Syntax**

Is anything incorrect? Do any of the stories/metaphors misrepresent concepts? Metaphors are not
100% accurate but is anything "too" inaccurate? Are there any words that misrepresent concepts?
One word can change the entire meaning of a sentence.
