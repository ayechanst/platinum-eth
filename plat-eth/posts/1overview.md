# Introduction

Platinum Ethereum is an open-source project dedicated to teaching the
Web3 ecosystem to Web2 developers. If you are completely new to programming,
check out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The best way
The Odin Project creator's describe it is: "What I wish I had when I was
learning". It's been the inspiration for Platinum Ethereum, and I wanted to
bring this their teaching methods to Web3. It serves as the "last stop"
before your ready to build your own projects, and land a job!
