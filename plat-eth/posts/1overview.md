# Under Construction

Platinum-Eth is being built right now. For now
the site is being designed and formatted. The first thing that will be done is challenge 0:
Simple NFT and I will work on the challenges in order. Stay tuned!

# The Goal of Platinum-Eth

Platinum-Eth is a course that helps you build a model of how the Ethereum ecosystem works,
by guiding you through the "behind the scenes" of each [Speed Run Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/)
challenge.

The goal of the course is to provide you with context and knowledge at the same pace you
would be applying the knowledge in each Speed Run Ethereum challenge. This course is **not**
supposed to feel like:

> Remember this, now remember that, don't forget this,

but rather:

> Here's this thing, here's what it's made of, it exists for these reasons... ect.

Don't pressure yourself to remember. As you progress through the challenges the
information will naturally stick because you'll have a real-world application.

To make things stick more naturally, I've wrapped knowledge and context within a story.
You'll notice a lot of metaphors in Platinum-Eth. These metaphors are more than just a
teaching aid, they serve as anchors for knowledge. The anchors keep knowledge from floating
out of your brain as you progress and eventually surpass what this course can teach you.

The anchors for the knowledge all rest on top of a world called
Platinum-Ethereum. I chose the name because to "platinum," a game means earning every achievement. It is the opposite of "speed running" a game. The world/course creates a
"middle road" where you are not forced to speed run through Ethereum, nor are you forced to
consume endless blogs, videos, or documentation. You have the choice to lean into as much or
as little of the roads offered.

# Where the anchors lay

The world of Platinum-Eth is the context in which the anchors lay. The locations, characters,
and events are the anchors to which the knowledge is tied. The dynamics between the context and
the anchors create the emergent property of a **Ethereum Ecosystem** model.

Stories form the dynamics of the world. This design choice was made because brains are
better evolved to recall stories that involve places, people, and events we can picture
in our heads rather than remembering procedures involving concepts, objects, and code.

# That is to say...

Do not overlook the analogies within Platinum-Eth. I encourage you to do your own research
if the analogies do not sit well with you, only you know how you learn best.
All this course is, is a culmination of my own research packaged in a manner I hope can
be more easily understood than independent research.

Platinum-Eth is a model, not documentation. In fact, most of my information comes from the
[Ethereum Documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/). A model
is an inaccurate representation of something. It's these inaccuracies that make models such a
useful tool because we can focus our attention on what's important.

If you're going through
Speed Run Ethereum, I'm assuming what is important to you is becoming a builder in Web3 and
joining the [Build Guild](https://app.buidlguidl.com/)! Platinum-Eth's model focuses on
a holistic understanding of blockchain. It is not tailored to any profession in Web3
in particular, but rather to all occupations. As you move out of here, you will have
a model you can extend and modify to suit your needs! Good Luck!

<!-- A cannonical universe where concepts in Web3 are explained through one long continous analogy.

A space faring civilization is building planet sized blocks in outer space. On these blocks exist
train stations (EOAs), factories (smart contrats), orbiting space ships (node validators), and
flying trains (trainsactions/transactions). At the core of each space block is a tree.

There are characters, events, and a narrative designed to explain Web3 in a fun and memorable way.

Plat-Eth currently is under construction. In its first phase, it will be a series of articles
explaining concepts people encounter while going through Speed Run Ethereum. It assumes zero
knowledge and leaves nothing in SRE challenges unexplained.

## Why Platinum-Ethereum

Learning about Web3 and its technology is hard and daunting. The pitfalls I identified were the
lack of holisitic explanations, and poor strategies for conceptualizing and remembering how Web3
is built, and how to make meaningful contributions. A lot of resources explains concepts in a
vacuum, or with poor context of the bigger picture. Concepts are also explained literally instead
of metaphorically, making them hard to remember because information is not packaged in a human-brain
friendly way.

## How is Platinum-Ethereum made?

Plat-Eth is built around a pedagogy I developed through reading books on teaching and learning, and
having extensive conversations about them with my peers. Here is the breakdown of the pedagogy.

### Models

I wrote an article about models on Medium that goes into more detail [here](https://medium.com/@ayechansant/5-steps-to-learn-anything-using-models-db7dadb1e492).

Platinum-Eth was born from a discussion with a friend about conceptualizing things through a model.
We concluded that understanding (it was sort of an epistemological conversation)
is best viewed through the lens of models.
People who understand things quicker than others have a better model built into their
heads.

A pre-built model is a large part of the value Plat-Eth brings to people. Learning
is about lowering the friction between gaining and remembering information. If people
are given a model, they don't have to spend time building their own.

### A Learning Path

Standing on the shoulders of giants, Plat-Eth is meant to be experienced alongside Speed Run Ethereum.
This design choice was made so that people could learn about a concept, and either immediately apply
their knowledge, or see the concept work in front of them through the SRE challenges.

### A Memory Device

What makes Plat-Eth different from other Web3 educational resources is its emmbedded memory framework.
Its designed specifically to make information easy to recall at a later date, decreasing the amount of
times people need to re-learn a concept if forgotten. The memory recall framework comes from the book
[Unlimited Memory](https://www.unlimitedfocus.info/) by Kevin Horsely.

I've applied teachings from this book in my own life to great success. I also wrote an article about the
power of stories and a real example in [this](https://medium.com/@ayechansant/you-already-have-photographic-memory-check-this-out-d4d198d13048)
Medium article.

The issue is that creating these
memory shortcuts takes time and planning. Plat-Eth offloads the work onto me, where I am the one embedding
the memory framework into concepts, so users can just lay back, relax, read, learn, and remember! -->

<!-- # The Ethereum Ecosystem Overview

The Ethereum ecosystem fundamentally is a network of accounts sending transactions
to smart contracts, and other accounts. With this simple explanation, we can start
building a model world for explanation, understanding, and remembering.

What are our peices so far?

- Accounts
- Smart Contracts
- Transactions

Let's lock these three things into memory with a story.

# Train Station

Accounts are train stations owned by real people. These train stations is where
people keep their money and belongings. To communicate with other accounts,
train stations send transactions to each other.

# Trains

Transactions are like trains, add an "i" to transaction to make the word trainsaction.
These trains carry materials for factories, gas, money, and other things we'll cover
in depth later.

# Factories

Smart Contracts are another kind of account, but these accounts behave more like factories
than train stations. Trains unload their material at factories, the factories proccesses
the material, stores material, and sends a new train back to the train station. Sometimes
factories send trains to other factories. Smart contracts can do a lot of things, so we
won't explain them in this summary.

# Combining train stations, trains, and factories to build our world

Our world is sci-fi. Imagine a long row of planet sized blocks in outer space, connected
by a thick chain. On the surface of the blocks, there are thousands of train stations and
factories spread out with millions of trains flying through the air to different blocks.
Welcome to the world of Platinum Ethereum. -->
