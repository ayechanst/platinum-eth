# Introduction

Platinum Ethereum is an open-source project dedicated to teaching the
Web3 ecosystem to Web2 developers.

If you are completely new to programming,
check out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The best way
The Odin Project creator's describe it is: "What I wish I had when I was
learning".

It's been the inspiration for Platinum Ethereum, and I wanted to
bring their teaching methods to Web3. It serves as the "last stop" before
you're ready to build your own projects, and land a job!

Platinum-Eth is carefully structured to introduce articles and concepts
**as the become relevant**, so that you arn't bouncing around tutorials and
going down rabbit-holes that arn't yet relevant. If a concept doesn't make
sense yet, hold on, because as you progress concepts will be re-visited and
things will start making sense. If you need to do your own research, stay
focused and avoid endless tutorials!

We will start by getting familiar with the three building blocks of Web3:
**accounts**, **smart contracts**, and **transactions**, by using a grand
cannonical-universe analogy.

# How it works

Platinum Ethereum is a collection of articles structured around hands-on
projects from [Speed Run Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/).

You will build **skill** completeing Speed-Run-Eth challenges, and you will
build **knowledge** completeing Platinum-Eth sections.

The course is structured in a way that concepts build from each other. So
skipping around will cause knowledge gaps, even if you are already somewhat
familiar with a topic. Trust the course, it never hurts to read about something
you already know, explained differently.

**DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING**

## It's a -tool- just as it is a -reasource-

The tool aspect is a [mind map](https://medium.com/productivitydirectory/what-is-a-mind-map-your-comprehensive-guide-to-thinking-visually-89c97bb9f9e1). The reasource aspect is an organized and currated
list of articles and videos focused on a single topic, with no more, no less than
you need to know at the given stage in your progression.

### The Tool

Web3 is a lot at first, but Platinum-Eth starts by boiling
away everything except the three fundamental concepts: accounts, smart contracts,
and transactions. These **abstract** concepts are explained through interconnected
**analogies**, giving them an anchor to the real world. This will be your
mind map, the heavy lifting of building one is done for you.

**Accounts** are train stations, **smart contracts** are factories, and **transactions**
are trains. These three pillars all exist on a vast railway network, think of the
Wild West.

As you progress in your learning journey, train stations are given more
details related to the functionality of accounts. The same applies to the factories
and trains. Different buildings, vehicles, and characters are introduced the further
you venture. At the end, you should have a holistic understanding of how concepts in
Web3 relate to each other.

### The Reasource

Blogs and videos will be provided to explain topics. Platinum-Eth will give a short
pre-read for things you should ignore in the blog or video, to stay on track and
build knowledge in a sensible order. You don't need to know about gas-optimization
before knowing how smart contracts work for example.

Platinum-Eth's links to articles are chosen specifically because **WE** blockchain
developers find them valuable. The internet is overloaded with fluff, internet
marketing, paid courses, and time-wasting.

Links to articles and videos have been pre-vetted
by myself and others, so you can find your treasure without sifting through too much
garbage (This is what **I** wish I had when I was learning Web3).

### Assignments

Similar to The Odin Project, Platinum Ethereum has assignments to complete. View these
not as home work, but as **exploration**. The assignments will be articles, videos,
and steps in the Speed Run Ethereum challenges!

Remember that reasources in assignments are not arbitrarily chosen with a simple google
search! Let's start with these:

1. Read [this](https://medium.com/productivitydirectory/what-is-a-mind-map-your-comprehensive-guide-to-thinking-visually-89c97bb9f9e1) article about what mind maps are. Understanding mind maps is crucial, because its the "raison d'etre" (reason of existing) of Platinum-Eth.

2. Straight from The Odin Project, they have an amazing [article](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-motivation-and-mindset) on meta-learning and mindset, to prime you for your juicy journey!
