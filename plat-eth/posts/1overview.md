# Under Construction

Platinum-Eth is being built right now. For now
the site is being designed and formatted. The first thing that will be done is challenge 0:
Simple NFT and I will work on the challenges in order. Stay tuned!

# The Goal of Platinum-Eth

Platinum-Eth is a course that helps you build a model of how the Ethereum ecosystem works,
by guiding you through the "behind the scenes" of each [Speed Run Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/)
challenge.

The goal of the course is to provide you with context and knowledge at the same pace you
would be applying the knowledge in each Speed Run Ethereum challenge. This course is **not**
supposed to feel like:

> Remember this, now remember that, don't forget this,

but rather:

> Here's this thing, here's what it's made of, it exists for these reasons... ect.

Don't pressure yourself to remember. As you progress through the challenges the
information will naturally stick because you'll have a real-world application.

To make things stick more naturally, I've wrapped knowledge and context within a story.
You'll notice a lot of metaphors in Platinum-Eth. These metaphors are more than just a
teaching aid, they serve as anchors for knowledge. The anchors keep knowledge from floating
out of your brain as you progress and eventually surpass what this course can teach you.

The anchors for the knowledge all rest on top of a world called
Platinum-Ethereum. I chose the name because to "platinum," a game means earning every achievement. It is the opposite of "speed running" a game. The world/course creates a
"middle road" where you are not forced to speed run through Ethereum, nor are you forced to
consume endless blogs, videos, or documentation. You have the choice to lean into as much or
as little of the roads offered.

## Where the anchors lay

The world of Platinum-Eth is the context in which the anchors lay. The locations, characters,
and events are the anchors to which the knowledge is tied. The dynamics between the context and
the anchors create the emergent property of a **Ethereum Ecosystem** model.

Stories form the dynamics of the world. This design choice was made because brains are
better evolved to recall stories that involve places, people, and events we can picture
in our heads rather than remembering procedures involving concepts, objects, and code.

## That is to say...

Do not overlook the analogies within Platinum-Eth. I encourage you to do your own research
if the analogies do not sit well with you, only you know how you learn best.
All this course is, is a culmination of my own research packaged in a manner I hope can
be more easily understood than independent research.

Platinum-Eth is a model, not documentation. In fact, most of my information comes from the
[Ethereum Documentation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/). A model
is an inaccurate representation of something. It's these inaccuracies that make models such a
useful tool because we can focus our attention on what's important.

If you're going through
Speed Run Ethereum, I'm assuming what is important to you is becoming a builder in Web3 and
joining the [Build Guild](https://app.buidlguidl.com/)! Platinum-Eth's model focuses on
a holistic understanding of blockchain. It is not tailored to any profession in Web3
in particular, but rather to all occupations. As you move out of here, you will have
a model you can extend and modify to suit your needs! Good Luck!

# FEED BACK

Feed back will be different from newbies and veterans, so I split the surveys.
Newbies tell me how the course **feels**, vets tell me how the course **is**.
Please read details about the survey questions before taking it. This is to improve the
accuracy of your much appreciated feedback. Thanks!

I prefer overly harsh critisim than overly nice, I'm ready to throw it all out if I have to.
I serve the public!

## FEED BACK from newbies

Platinum-Ethereum is everything I know about the blockchain so far. It solves my problems and
questions **I** used to have. This was the only logical starting point for me, but of course
this course isn't for me it's for **you**!

**Idea Building**

How well do the concepts build on each other? I designed it so that there is **just enough**
information to move onto a different concept. There should be enough information that new
concepts are not **too** foreign, and not so much information that you feel overwhelmed.
How well did I accomplish the goal?

NOTE: Learning requires discomfort, my job is to lower the discomfort I can't abolish it.

**Tone**

How do you like the tone? My goal was to write in a fun, inquisitive, and engaging
manner, similar to Speed Run Eth. If the tone is too fun, too inquisitive, and too engaging
its probably full of fluff which is not what I'm aiming for. How well did I accomplish this
goal?

**Stories (both newbs and vets)**

How do you like the stories? My goal was to wrap complexity into simple stories that conveys
the utility of the complexity without revealing the complexity. How well did I accomplish this
goal?

Are the stories memorable, can you picture Platinum-Eth in your head? This is supposed to be a
cannonical universe after all, although this is just the start.

**Active Recall Exercizes**

How do you feel about these? Are they dumb? Did you think through them or did you scroll past.
I do that a lot full disclaimer but if they help a few people that's a win. Assuming people use
them, my goal with active recall was to ask beyond-surface-level questions. Maybe even open
ended at times.

My aim was to create questions similar to a [Socratic Seminar](https://www.teachthought.com/critical-thinking/definition-of-socratic-seminar/)
where people just discuss a topic to gain insight about it.

**Paragraph Density**

This is more stylistic, but I hate fluff. Just get to the point! However when teaching you can
lose some people if the text is too dry. To combine fun and information, I re-wrote the same ideas
in different sentence structures to maximize information transfer while keeping the text short.

To me it's like writing elegant flexible programs: it does a lot, but it's **short**. How well did
I accomplish this goal?

**Jargon Alert!**

Where you also confused about those terms? What other terms should I add that you hear people throw
around and you're like "I have no idea what that means". My goal was to define jargon, and also tell
you what it **really** means. How well did I do this?

**Syntax**

Are there any ambigous sentences?

## FEED BACK from veterans

How's the content, structure, and flow?

**Scope Relevance**

My goal here was to introduce concepts only as they came up in the Speed Run Eth challenges as not
to overwhelm learners, and also make sure they immediately saw the concept being brought up. How
well was this accomplished?

**Metaphors**

From the way you visualize the block chain as a model, how relevant are the metaphors? My goal was
to link Web3 ideas to the real world in one continuous metaphor. How well did I accomplish this?

**Target Audience**

My target audience are new people who know nothing about the blockchain, does the content reflect
that? Is anything too "out of reach" or irrelevant for most jobs in Web3?

**Correctness/Syntax**

Is anything incorrect? Do any of the stories/metaphors misrepresent concepts? Metaphors are not
100% accurate but is anything "too" inaccurate? Are there any words that misrepresent concepts?
One word can change the entire meaning of a sentence.
