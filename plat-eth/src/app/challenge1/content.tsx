As you stand in front of the train station, you see a tranquil little pond with lilly pads, and you can smell the mud and feel the freshness radiating from the little pond. You can taste familiarity when you stand on the little cobblestone path leading up to the train stations front door.",
    "How are accounts train stations? Well, they can send and receive money, have an address, and have a lock on the door, just like a train station. What does an account look like on the blockchain? Let's build a conceptual account with our minds so we remember. Get ready to go into creativity overdrive! The more ridiculous, the better you'll remember. ",
