Problem:
Do you ever learn something complex and realize you don't know how to do the thing you just learned? Is it because you don't
remember how or because you have not practiced doing that thing enough? Sometimes, even after hours of working away
at a problem, you don't understand what you don't understand. You try something the way you learned, and it doesn't work.
So you try it your way; it works, but you just can't explain it. Or you get creative and try something the
way you think it works but fails without a clear cause of failure. I've had endless frustration with this
feedback loop of referring to examples and documentation and trying it out only to have it fail. Leaving me frustrated at
the documentation and myself.

Amplify:
If you think you need to practice more, you might end up practicing the wrong
way. Training yourself the wrong way is detrimental because you're future self will need to
unlearn the training and habits you built up. So now
you are fumbling through the problem, getting bits and pieces. Still, the solution is wrong or at best messy, because there was no context
or information about the problem or knowledge of previous, more efficient solutions.

Now, a different you thinks you need more information and knowledge about the problem at hand. You hit the books and learn voraciously.
All of this information will help solve the problem. All you need is more context to understand the
problem. Let's say you have the context and information now, to solve the problem. The problem is still
staring you in the face, and you have no idea where to start. The longer you stare at the problem, the more you
think and forget the context and information about the problem you just learned.

Solution:
The solution to this churning issue of practice and context is understanding the difference between skill and
knowledge. If you are learning something complex, there is interplay between skill and knowledge.
To isolate skill and knowledge, let's walk through an example of a non-complex task, such as changing a lightbulb.
Two people will handle the task, Mr. Skill and Mr. Knowledge. Mr. Skill only has skills for changing a lightbulb
and no knowledge of lightbulbs. Mr. Knowledge knows everything there is to know about lightbulbs but has
no skill in performing the task. Mr. Skill gets the lightbulb supplies, looks at the lightbulb, immediately begins to
touch and fiddle around with it. He tries screwing in the wrong-sized lightbulb and later flawlessly screws in the right-sized wrong type of
lightbulb. Meanwhile, Mr. Knowledge gets his supplies and stares at the broken lightbulb, knowing everything about the metals, the volts, and the physics,
but no practice at a lightbulb changing procedure. Neither a surplus of knowledge nor a high amount of skill alone
can solve the problem.

Skill is something that is trained or practiced over time. Knowledge is simply just information. To solve your
problem, you need the right amount of skill paired with the right amount of knowledge. Understanding if the problem
you can't solve is due to a knowledge or skill gap is critical. How can you tell if you are experiencing a
skill or knowledge gap? If you are comfortable navigating the problem and the problem feels familiar, you are
probably experiencing a knowledge gap. You have the skill and practice, but without more knowledge and context, solving
the problem can result in a arduous overengineered solution. Go read about the problem. Read about what you need to solve the problem at this given
moment. No more and no less, lest you end up in tutorial hell.

If you are comfortable explaining what different components in your problem are doing, or if you can reason about the
problem and know the desired outcome, you have a skill gap. You have context, but you need to practice more to articulate your
solution. You must scale down the problem
to practice the smaller components and build your way to the final solution. You have the knowledge to find the solution,
but you need to practice the skill on manageable chunks of information to arrive at the solution.

Transformation:
So, when learning about a complex topic, how do you acquire minimum viable knowledge to start building minimal viable skills?
In order to then, move back to minimal knowledge acquisition to keep building minimal skill again. Or vice
versa, develop minimal viable skill to find out what knowledge you're missing, to ask the question that will return minimal
viable knowledge. Either way is acceptable, but significant gaps between skill acquisition and knowledge acquisition are a sure way
to frustration or suboptimal learning. Learning is hard, why make it harder than it needs to be? So what is
the best way to keep the gap between knowledge and skill from getting too wide? Well, there's no answer because every field of learning
is different. However, being acutely aware of the distinction between
skill and knowledge helps you diagnose your learning troubles. Remember, identify if the problem you are
facing is due to a skill or knowledge gap, then fill the gap accordingly.
