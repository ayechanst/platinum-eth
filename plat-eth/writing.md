Problem:
Do you ever learn something complex and realize you don't know how to do the thing you just learned? Is it because you don't
remember how, or becuase you have not practiced doing that thing enough? Sometimes even after hours of working away
at a problem you just don't understand what you don't understand. You try something the way you learned and it doesnt work,
but when you
try something your own way, it works and you just can't explain it. Or maybe you get creative try something the
way you think it works, but in fact it does not work the way you thought it did. I've had endless frustration with this
feedback loop of refering to examples or documentation, and trying it out for myself. I feel the pain.

Amplify:
But why might this be a problem? Well if you think you need to practice more, then you might end up practicing the wrong
way of doing things. Training yourself to do things the wrong way is detrimental because you are making it harder for
your future self to unlearn the habits you built up. Doing things the wrong was is also bad in and of itself. So now
you are fumbling your way through the problem getting bits and peices but its all wrong because there is no context
or information about problem or knowledge of previous more-efficient-solutions.

Now imagine you think you need more information about the problem at hand. You hit the books and learn voraciously.
All of this information will surely help solve the problem right? All you needed was more context to understand the
problem. Ok lets say you have the context now, all the information even, to solve the problem. Now the problem is
staring at you in the face and you have no idea where to start. The longer you stare at the problem, the more you
think, and the more you forget the information and context you just learned.

Solution:
The solution to this churing issue of practice and context is understanding the difference between a skill and
knowledge. If you are learning something complex, there is probably a lot of interplay between skill and knowledge.
To isolate skill and knowledge lets walk through an example of a non-complex task such as changing a lightbulb,
handled by two different people. Mr. Skill and Mr. Knowledge. Mr. Skill only has skills for changing a lightbulb
and no knowledge about lightbulbs, and Mr. Knowledge knows everything there is to know about lightbulbs, but has
no skill in performing the task. Mr. Skill gets the lightbulb changing supplies and looks at lightbulb and has no
idea what to do. He tries screwing in the wrong sized lightbulb, and later flawlessly screws in the wrong type of
lightbulb that happened to fit. Meanwhile Mr. Knowledge get his supplies and just stares at the broken lightbulb
knowing everything about the metals, the volts, and lightbulb physics. But he does not know where to start with
the lightbulb changing procedure.

So skill is something that is trained over time, or practiced. Knowledge is simply just information. To solve your
problem you need the right amount of skill, paired with the right amount of knowledge. Understanding if the problem
you can't solve is due to a knowledge gap or a skill gap is critical. How can you tell if you are experiencing a
skill gap or a knowledge gap? If you are comfortable navigating the problem and the problem feels familiar, you are
probably experiencing a knowledge gap. You have the skill and practice, but without more knowledge and context solving
the problems might feel futile. Go read about the problem. Read about what you need to solve the problem at this given
moment. No more and no less, lest you end up in tutorial hell.

If you are comfortable explaining what different components of your problem are doing, or if you can reason about the
problem and you know what the desired outcome should be, you have a skill gap. You know the ins and outs of the problem
and you have context, but you have not practiced enough to articulate your solution. You need to scale down the problem
and practice the smaller components to build your way up to the final solution. You have the knowledge to complete the
task, but you need to scale the task down to practice skill on managable chunks.

Transformation:
So when learning about a complex topic, what is the best way to get the minimum knowledge to start minimal skill building?
Then move back to minimal knowledge aquisition to practice minimal skill again for the step up in difficulty. Or vice
versa, fist develop minimal skill, in order to find out what you don't know to ask the question that will return minimal
knowledge. Either way is fine, but I think large gaps between skill aquisition and knowledge aquisition is a sure way
to frustration or plain suboptimal learning. And learning is hard so why make it harder than it need to be? So what is
the best way? Well there's no answer because every field is different. But being acutley aware of the distinction between
skill and knowledge I hope helps you in diagnosing your learning troubles. Remember, identify if the problem you are
facing is due to a skill gap, or a knowledge gap, then fill the gap accordingly.

Problem:
Do you ever learn something complex and realize you don't know how to do the thing you just learned? Is it because you don't
remember how or because you have not practiced doing that thing enough? Sometimes, even after hours of working away
at a problem, you don't understand what you don't understand. You try something the way you learned, and it doesn't work.
So you try it your way; it works, but you just can't explain it. Or you get creative and try something the
way you think it works but fails without a clear cause of failure. I've had endless frustration with this
feedback loop of referring to examples and documentation and trying it out only to have it fail. Leaving me frustrated at
the documentation and myself.

Amplify:
If you think you need to practice more, you might end up practicing the wrong
way. Training yourself the wrong way is detrimental because you're future self will need to
unlearn the training and habits you built up. So now
you are fumbling through the problem, getting bits and pieces. Still, the solution is wrong or at best messy, because there was no context
or information about the problem or knowledge of previous, more efficient solutions.

Now, a different you thinks you need more information and knowledge about the problem at hand. You hit the books and learn voraciously.
All of this information will help solve the problem. All you need is more context to understand the
problem. Let's say you have the context and information now, to solve the problem. The problem is still
staring you in the face, and you have no idea where to start. The longer you stare at the problem, the more you
think and forget the context and information about the problem you just learned.

Solution:
The solution to this churning issue of practice and context is understanding the difference between skill and
knowledge. If you are learning something complex, there is interplay between skill and knowledge.
To isolate skill and knowledge, let's walk through an example of a non-complex task, such as changing a lightbulb.
Two people will handle the task, Mr. Skill and Mr. Knowledge. Mr. Skill only has skills for changing a lightbulb
and no knowledge of lightbulbs. Mr. Knowledge knows everything there is to know about lightbulbs but has
no skill in performing the task. Mr. Skill gets the lightbulb supplies, looks at the lightbulb, immediately begins to
touch and fiddle around with it. He tries screwing in the wrong-sized lightbulb and later flawlessly screws in the right-sized wrong type of
lightbulb. Meanwhile, Mr. Knowledge gets his supplies and stares at the broken lightbulb, knowing everything about the metals, the volts, and the physics,
but no practice at a lightbulb changing procedure. Neither a surplus of knowledge nor a high amount of skill alone
can solve the problem.

Skill is something that is trained or practiced over time. Knowledge is simply just information. To solve your
problem, you need the right amount of skill paired with the right amount of knowledge. Understanding if the problem
you can't solve is due to a knowledge or skill gap is critical. How can you tell if you are experiencing a
skill or knowledge gap? If you are comfortable navigating the problem and the problem feels familiar, you are
probably experiencing a knowledge gap. You have the skill and practice, but without more knowledge and context, solving
the problem can result in a arduous overengineered solution. Go read about the problem. Read about what you need to solve the problem at this given
moment. No more and no less, lest you end up in tutorial hell.

If you are comfortable explaining what different components in your problem are doing, or if you can reason about the
problem and know the desired outcome, you have a skill gap. You have context, but you need to practice more to articulate your
solution. You must scale down the problem
to practice the smaller components and build your way to the final solution. You have the knowledge to find the solution,
but you need to practice the skill on manageable chunks of information to arrive at the solution.

Transformation:
So, when learning about a complex topic, how do you acquire minimum viable knowledge to start building minimal viable skills?
In order to then, move back to minimal knowledge acquisition to keep building minimal skill again. Or vice
versa, develop minimal viable skill to find out what knowledge you're missing, to ask the question that will return minimal
viable knowledge. Either way is acceptable, but significant gaps between skill acquisition and knowledge acquisition are a sure way
to frustration or suboptimal learning. Learning is hard, why make it harder than it needs to be? So what is
the best way to keep the gap between knowledge and skill from getting too wide? Well, there's no answer because every field of learning
is different. However, being acutely aware of the distinction between
skill and knowledge helps you diagnose your learning troubles. Remember, identify if the problem you are
facing is due to a skill or knowledge gap, then fill the gap accordingly.
