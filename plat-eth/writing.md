Problem:
Do you ever learn something hard and realize you don't know how to do the thing you just learned? Is it because you don't
remember how, or becuase you have not practiced doing that thing enough? Sometimes even after hours of working away
at a problem you just don't understand what you don't understand. You try something the way you learned and it doesnt work,
but when you
try something your own way, it works and you just can't explain it. Or maybe you get creative try something the
way you think it works, but in fact it does not work the way you thought it did. I've had endless frustration with this
feedback loop of refering to examples or documentation, and trying it out for myself. I feel the pain.

Amplify:
Why might this be a problem? Well if you think you need to practice more, then you might end up practicing the wrong
way of doing things. Training yourself to do things the wrong way is detrimental because you are making it harder for
your future self to unlearn the habits you built up. Doing things the wrong was is also bad in and of itself. So now
you are fumbling your way through the problem getting bits and peices but its all wrong because there is no context
or information about problem or knowledge of previous more-efficient-solutions.

Now imagine you think you need more information about the problem at hand. You hit the books and learn voraciously.
All of this information will surely help solve the problem right? All you needed was more context to understand the
problem. Ok lets say you have the context now, all the information even, to solve the problem. Now the problem is
staring at you in the face and you have no idea where to start. The longer you stare at the problem, the more you
think, and the more you forget the information and context you just learned.

Solution:
The solution to this churing issue of practice and context is understanding the difference between a skill and
knowledge.
