# Platinum-Eth

A cannonical universe where concepts in Web3 are explained through on long continous analogy.

A space faring civilization is building planet sized blocks in outer space. On these blocks exist
train stations (EOAs), factories (smart contrats), orbiting space ships (node validators), and
flying trains (trainsactions/transactions). At the core of each space block is a tree.

There are characters, events, and a narrative designed to explain Web3 in a fun and memorable way.

## Why Platinum-Ethereum

Learning about Web3 and its technology is hard and daunting. The pitfalls I identified were the
lack of holisitic explanations, and poor strategies for conceptualizing and remembering how Web3
is built, and how to make meaningful contributions. A lot of resources explains concepts in a
vacuum, or with poor context of the bigger picture. Concepts are also explained literally instead
of metaphorically, making them hard to remember because information is not packaged in a human-brain
friendly way.

## How is Platinum-Ethereum made?

Plat-Eth is built around a pedagogy I developed through reading books on teaching and learning, and
having extensive conversations about them with my peers. Here is the breakdown of the pedagogy.
