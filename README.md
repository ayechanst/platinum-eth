# Platinum-Eth

A cannonical universe where concepts in Web3 are explained through one long continous analogy.

A space faring civilization is building planet sized blocks in outer space. On these blocks exist
train stations (EOAs), factories (smart contrats), orbiting space ships (node validators), and
flying trains (trainsactions/transactions). At the core of each space block is a tree.

There are characters, events, and a narrative designed to explain Web3 in a fun and memorable way.

Plat-Eth currently is under construction. In its first phase, it will be a series of articles
explaining concepts people encounter while going through Speed Run Ethereum. It assumes zero
knowledge and leaves nothing in SRE challenges unexplained.

## Why Platinum-Ethereum

Learning about Web3 and its technology is hard and daunting. The pitfalls I identified were the
lack of holisitic explanations, and poor strategies for conceptualizing and remembering how Web3
is built, and how to make meaningful contributions. A lot of resources explains concepts in a
vacuum, or with poor context of the bigger picture. Concepts are also explained literally instead
of metaphorically, making them hard to remember because information is not packaged in a human-brain
friendly way.

## How is Platinum-Ethereum made?

Plat-Eth is built around a pedagogy I developed through reading books on teaching and learning, and
having extensive conversations about them with my peers. Here is the breakdown of the pedagogy.

#### Models

I wrote an article about models on Medium that goes into more detail [here](https://medium.com/@ayechansant/5-steps-to-learn-anything-using-models-db7dadb1e492).

Platinum-Eth was born from a discussion with a friend about conceptualizing things through a model.
We concluded that understanding (it was sort of an epistemological conversation)
is best viewed through the lens of models.
People who understand things quicker than others have a better model built into their
heads.

A pre-built model is a large part of the value Plat-Eth brings to people. Learning
is about lowering the friction between gaining and remembering information. If people
are given a model, they don't have to spend time building their own.

#### A Learning Path

Standing on the shoulders of giants, Plat-Eth is meant to be experienced alongside Speed Run Ethereum.
This design choice was made so that people could learn about a concept, and either immediately apply
their knowledge, or see the concept work in front of them through the SRE challenges.

#### A Memory Device

What makes Plat-Eth different from other Web3 educational resources is its emmbedded memory framework.
Its designed specifically to make information easy to recall at a later date, decreasing the amount of
times people need to re-learn a concept if forgotten. The memory recall framework comes from the book
[Unlimited Memory](https://www.unlimitedfocus.info/) by Kevin Horsely.

I've applied teachings from this book in my own life to great success. I also wrote an article about the
power of stories and a real example in [this](https://medium.com/@ayechansant/you-already-have-photographic-memory-check-this-out-d4d198d13048)
Medium article.

The issue is that creating these
memory shortcuts takes time and planning. Plat-Eth offloads the work onto me, where I am the one embedding
the memory framework into concepts, so users can just lay back, relax, read, learn, and remember!
